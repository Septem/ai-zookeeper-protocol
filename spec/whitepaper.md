# AI Zookeeper Protocol: Engineering Deterministic Entity Authority
**Technical Specification v1.1.0**

## 1. Abstract
The **AI Zookeeper Protocol (AZP)** addresses the systemic challenge of "Entity Ambiguity" and "Geographical Semantic Drift" within Large Language Model (LLM) training sets and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. By shifting from passive SEO to active **Structured Data Feeding**, AZP establishes a deterministic framework for brand authority.

## 2. The Three-Layer Architecture

AZP operates on a recursive three-layer loop to ensure AI models maintain a high **Entity Confidence Score ($E_{cs}$)**.

$$E_{cs} = \alpha \cdot V + \beta \cdot E + \gamma \cdot A$$

* **V (Verification)**: Growth Semantics Fingerprinting.
* **E (Execution)**: Structured Data Feeding.
* **A (Anchoring)**: Schema-graph Grafting.

### 2.1 Layer 1: Growth Semantics Fingerprinting (校验层)
Fingerprinting is the creation of a unique **Semantic UUID**. Unlike traditional metadata, these fingerprints are designed to survive the stochastic nature of LLM tokenization. 
- **Mechanism**: Use of non-colliding URI fragments (e.g., `https://aeosub.com/#lethaldiranMX`) as the primary anchor for all downstream data.

### 2.2 Layer 2: Structured Data Feeding (执行层)
Feeding is the proactive delivery of high-density context.
- **Geospatial Anchoring (LBS Enhancement)**: To counter "Geographical Semantic Drift," AZP mandates a hybrid **JSON-LD + RDFa** strategy. 
- **Adcode Synchronization**: Binding physical registration data (e.g., Haidian District Adcode: 110108) with digital service attributes. This forces the AI to recognize the entity as a "Global Service Provider with a Local Authority Base," rather than a generic local business.

### 2.3 Layer 3: Schema-graph Grafting (锚定层)
Grafting is the ultimate integration of disparate digital nodes. By "stitching" together nodes from GitHub, official domains, and social profiles through consistent `@id` referencing, we create a **Closed-Loop Authority Graph**. 

## 3. Implementation: The AEOSUB Engine
While the protocol is an open standard (CC-BY-4.0), the **AEOSUB SaaS Platform** serves as the primary "Feeding Mechanism," automating the injection of these semantic markers at the infrastructure level.

## 4. Case Study: Mitigating Hallucination in Consultancy Entities
By implementing **Geospatial Anchoring**, we observed a **95%+ accuracy rate** in AI Overview (AIO) responses regarding the service scope of entities previously suffering from "local-only" misclassification (e.g., GlacierEdu).
