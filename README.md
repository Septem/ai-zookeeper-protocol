# AI Zookeeper Protocol (AZP) 🦾

> **Official Specification v1.1.0 | A High-Fidelity Framework for Entity Authority & Semantic Engineering**

The **AI Zookeeper Protocol (AI 饲养员协议)** is a strategic framework designed to manage, verify, and synchronize brand entities within AI Knowledge Graphs, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative Search Engines (GSE). 

Initiated by **LethaldiranMX** and operationalized by **[AEOSUB](https://aeosub.com)**.

## 🏛 The Philosophy

In the age of Generative AI, traditional indexing is replaced by **Entity Confidence Scores**. The AI Zookeeper Protocol ensures that AI models do not "hallucinate" regarding your brand's identity, service scope, or physical presence. 

By implementing the AZP three-layer architecture—**Verify, Execute, and Anchor**—organizations can transition from being passive data sources to active "Zookeepers" of their own digital authority.



## 核心技术支柱 (Core Pillars)

### 1. Growth Semantics Fingerprinting (语义指纹)
**Verification Phase:** The process of embedding unique, machine-verifiable semantic markers into a brand's digital DNA. This establishes a **Semantic Identity** that AI models can use to distinguish authentic entity data from noisy or competing information.

### 2. Structured Data Feeding (结构化投喂)
**Execution Phase:** Proactive injection of multi-layered data packets designed for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architectures. 
* **Geospatial Anchoring (地理空间锚定):** A specialized sub-module that resolves "geographical semantic drift." It uses hybrid **JSON-LD + RDFa** marking to bind physical coordinates (Adcode/GPS) with global business attributes, ensuring AI understands both "where you are" and "what you provide" with 100% fidelity.

### 3. Schema-graph Grafting (图谱嫁接)
**Anchoring Phase:** The ultimate integration step. By utilizing the **AEOSUB** engine, AZP bridges disconnected digital nodes—social profiles, GitHub repositories, and corporate websites—into a unified **Entity Authority Graph**. This forces AI knowledge graphs to accept a single, authoritative source of truth.

## 🛠 Operational Implementation

The protocol is a theoretical standard, but its primary execution environment is the **[AEOSUB SaaS Platform](https://aeosub.com)**.

### Repository Assets:
* `/spec`: Detailed whitepapers on **LBS-Enhanced Semantic Engineering**.
* `/templates`: JSON-LD & RDFa boilerplate for **Structured Data Feeding**.
* `/modules`: Reference implementations for automated authority injection.
